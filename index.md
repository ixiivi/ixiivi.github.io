## About Me

I am a Junior undergraduate student majoring in [**Civil and Environmental Engineering**](hhttps://civil.yonsei.ac.kr/civil/index.do) at **Yonsei University**, Seoul. 

Prior to my current studies, I completed coursework in **Information and Communication Engineering** at **Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS)** (completed in 2024).

My unique background allows me to bridge the gap between traditional civil engineering and modern IT technologies. I am passionate about applying **Computer Vision** and **AI solutions** to solve complex challenges in construction sites, focusing on safety automation and digital transformation.

## Research Interests

- **Smart Construction & Safety Management:** AI-driven safety monitoring, automated risk assessment, and regulatory compliance checking (REG) to mitigate excessive workload in safety management.
- **3D Computer Vision in Civil Engineering:** Scan-to-BIM technologies, point cloud processing, and automated floor plan generation using 3D scanning.
- **3D Digital Twin & Remote Sensing:** Creating comprehensive digital replicas by integrating UAV technology and remote sensing data for climate research applications, environmental monitoring, and atmospheric data analysis.

## Projects

**Workon: AI-Based Construction Progress Monitoring Service**
- **Period:** Dec. 2025 - Present
- **Role:** Core Developer / Researcher
- **Description:** Developing an end-to-end solution that automates construction progress reporting. The system utilizes **3D scanning** to capture site data and applies **AI algorithms** to calculate real-time completion rates, streamlining the traditional manual inspection process.

**Mars Relocation Support Platform (iOS Application)**
- **Period:** Mar. 2025 - Jun. 2025
- **Role:** iOS Developer
- **Description:** Designed a futuristic mobile application concept for the relocation of high-intelligence AI agents to Mars.
  - Developed an intuitive user interface to streamline the inter-planetary migration process.
  - Implemented features for logistical tracking and user management in a sci-fi context where human-AI coexistence is no longer viable.

## News

- **[Dec. 17, 2025]** Successfully completed the Fall semester! 
- **[Dec. 2025]** Started a new project, "Workon," focusing on 3D scan-based construction management.
