## About Me

I am a Junior undergraduate student majoring in **Civil and Environmental Engineering** at **Yonsei University**. 
Previously, I studied Information and Communication Engineering at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) (2024).

My research focuses on the intersection of AI and spatial data, specifically in **AIGC detection**, **Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)**, and **3D Digital Twins**. I am passionate about applying deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in digital media and environmental monitoring.

## Research Interests

- **AIGC Detection:** Developing robust detection models for real-world datasets (e.g., TikTok, YouTube Shorts), focusing on generalization across diverse AI-generated content types and social media platforms.
- **Spiking Neural Networks:** Investigating model compression and efficiency optimization to bridge the performance gap between spiking and artificial neural networks (SNNs vs. ANNs) while maintaining computational efficiency.
- **3D Digital Twin:** Creating comprehensive digital replicas by integrating UAV technology and remote sensing data for climate research, environmental monitoring, and atmospheric analysis.

## Work Experience

- **[Jul. 2024 - Present]** **Undergraduate Researcher**, [Name of Lab/Company]
  - *(Please fill in the details of your role here)*

## Projects

- **[Dec. 2025 - Present] Workon: Construction Site 3D Scan & AI Reporting**
  - Developing an integrated service that automates construction progress reporting. The system utilizes 3D scanning technology to capture site data and employs AI to analyze and generate comprehensive progress reports.

- **[Mar. 2025 - Jun. 2025] Mars Relocation Support iOS Application**
  - Designed and developed an iOS application to support the relocation of high-intelligence AI robots to Mars in a post-war scenario. The app streamlines the migration process, offering an intuitive interface for logistics and user management.

## News
